      <template #section-desc>
        The capybara is nature's ultimate chill buddy, a giant guinea pig with a
        "no worries" attitude. With a face that says "I'm ready for a spa day,"
        this laid-back rodent is the real MVP of the animal kingdom's relaxation
        club. Just imagine a furry couch potato living its best life!
